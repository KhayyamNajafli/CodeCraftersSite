<h1 style="text-align: center; color: white;">About Our Website Project</h1>
<div class="content">
<p style="font-size: 30px">In this journey of creating this website using HTML, CSS, Javascript many things had to happen. Firstly, coding with HTML, CSS and Javascript had to be learned from Codecademy's courses. This website consists of four parts with each having its own purpose. The home page is the start of our website and it shows the team name. Then there is the members page where you can see the pictures of the members and learn more about the members. Unfortunately, our team was unable to do the Hour of Code project, which is why you can not find anything about the project in Hour of Code page. The page from which you are reading this is the information about our journey. About our project page also has links to the members Codecademy profiles from where you can see our progress.</p>
